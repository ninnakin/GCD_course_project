## The task 
The aim of the work done in this project is to practice and demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. For this purpose, the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset is used and manipulated.

## The original data 

The data used represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The original data can be found here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

And a description of the data can be found here:  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

## Input 


## Output 
The tidy dataset mean.measurements containing 190 measurements for 88 variables
mean.measurements is closer described in codebook.md 

## run_analysis.R
This repo cotains the file run_analysis.R which will take several files from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset and return a dataset containing the average values of a number of the original variables. Running the file will perform the following steps:
